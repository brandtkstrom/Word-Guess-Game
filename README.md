# Word Guess Game

This is a simple game where you have to guess a random word. Each word is randomly selected with a hint that displays a definition for the word. 

How to play:

 - Press a key to begin the game
 - Press 1 character at a time to try to reveal the word
 - There is a limit to the number of wrong guesses. If this limit is reached, then the game will be reset.
 - If the word is successfully matched, then the score is incremented by the length of the word and another word will be generated.
 - Try to get the highest score!!!
